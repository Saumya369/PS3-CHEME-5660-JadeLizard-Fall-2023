    "# PS4: Compute the Profit Diagram for a Jade Lizard at Expiration\n",
    "The [Jade-Lizard](https://www.tastylive.com/concepts-strategies/jade-lizard) is a composite options trade consisting of three option legs. The [Jade-Lizard](https://www.tastylive.com/concepts-strategies/jade-lizard) was created by [tasty-traders Liz and Jny](https://www.tastylive.com/shows/tweeting-live-with-liz-jny). A Jade Lizard is a relatively simple and popular option strategy best deployed when the trader has a neutral (i.e., sideways or range-bound) to bullish view of a given security. The [Jade-Lizard](https://www.tastylive.com/concepts-strategies/jade-lizard) consists of:\n",
    "* __Option 1__: 1 $\\times$ `short put` contract with strike price $K_{1}$ USD/share and premium $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ USD/share\n",
    "* __Option 2__: 1 $\\times$ `short call` contract with strike price $K_{2}$ USD/share and premium $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ USD/share\n",
    "* __Option 3__: 1 $\\times$ `long call` contract with strike price $K_{3}>K_{2}$ USD/share and premium $\\mathcal{P}_{3}$ USD/share\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "The objective of `PS4` is to familiarize students with constructing profit diagrams at expiration for typical composite options contracts, i.e., the [Jade-Lizard](https://www.tastylive.com/concepts-strategies/jade-lizard).\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Task 1__: Create the option contract models for the `Jade Lizard`\n",
    "    * `TODO`: Create `short put`, `short call`, and `long call` contract models using the strike prices and premiums provided below\n",
    "* __Task 2__: Compute the profit array at expiration for the `Jade Lizard`\n",
    "    * `TODO`: Build an array of share prices at expiration from `45.0` to `85.0` (already completed for you)\n",
    "    * `TODO`: Compute the profit array at expiration using the `profit(...)` function.\n",
    "* __Task 3__: Compute the properties of the `Jade Lizard`\n",
    "    * `TODO`: Compute the breakeven point at expiration for the trade\n",
    "    * `TODO`: Compute the maximum profit and maximum loss for the trade\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Other resources\n",
    "There are several examples of computing a composite contract’s profit (loss) at expiration in the `L9a` lecture examples and the `L9b` lab. \n",
